# A/B testing
As part of A/B testing, we do two projects. We do Udacity's final project on A/B. The project is theoretical though we implement modules to automate all the evaluations on Python for chosen model parameters. The project looks at the A/B testing performed on Udacity's website by adding a prompt informing the user about the commitment required when users try to enroll in a course. We take the invariant and evaluation metrics, perform sanity and effective size tests, and provide a recommendation on whether to launch a project.

We look at an experiment for the second project, devise the metrics, and perform SQL/python operations to perform the necessary data cleaning and organization to compute the metrics. Based on the metrics, we conclude whether or not the experiment provided evidence to implement the change.
